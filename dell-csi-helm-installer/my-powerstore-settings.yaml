# "connection" allows to configure connection to storage array
connection:
  # "connection.scsiProtocol" allows to specify which scsi protocol to use
  # Can be "FC", "ISCSI", "auto", "None". If "auto", will choose FC if both are available.
  # If "None" the driver will try to use NFS

# "nodeFCPortsFilterFile" is the name of the environment variable which store path to the file which
# provide list of WWPN which should be used by the driver for FC connection on this node
# example:
# content of the file:
#   21:00:00:29:ff:48:9f:6e,21:00:00:29:ff:48:9f:6e
# If file not exist or empty or in invalid format, then the driver will use all available FC ports
nodeFCPortsFilterFile: /etc/fc-ports-filter

# The installation process will generate multiple storageclasses based on these parameters.
# Only the primary storageclass for the driver will be marked default if specified.
storageClass:
  # "storageClass.name" defines the name of the storage class to be defined.
  name: powerstore

  # "storageClass.isDefault" defines whether the primary storage class should be the # default.
